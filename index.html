      <h2>About the Event</h2>
      <p>
        Ever wonder what it would be like if you pursued a different path? What if you had the possibility of becoming a journalist instead of an accountant? Or what if you had the capability of living in Singapore instead of the United States?
        <br><br>
        Well, you do not have to just ponder on these thoughts anymore! Welcome to Reboot Reality, where we offer exclusive parallel timeline consultations to help you discover what the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù of your life could really mean for a week.
        <br><br>
        Feeling stuck in the loophole of life? Let‚Äôs work to match you with an parallel universe to see what fits you best.
        <br><br>
        Through our pop-up event, you will have the chance to go through a free personalized session, where we will work to discover which consultation series would best help us discover your ideal parallel universe. Whether it is swapping careers, timelines, or a lifestyle, we‚Äôre here to give you a temporary leap into a reality better for you thanks to quantum physics.
        <br><br>
        Best of all, you do not have to fret about monetary costs. You will be paying with your soul (joking, joking‚Ä¶mostly).

      <h2>Reality Reboot Experience Timeline</h2>
  
      <p class="schedule-intro hidden">
        Welcome to your Reality Reboot journey. Over the next few months, you‚Äôll rethink your life choices, rewire your destiny, and possibly question your sanity (all very normal here).
        This schedule outlines every critical phase: from your free consultation to designing your alternate reality blueprint through the Reschedule Plan.
        You'll also undergo physical training ‚Äî nothing extreme, just enough so you don't disintegrate mid-jump into your alternate reality.
        After two months of prepping your mind <em>and</em> body, you‚Äôll finally step into your chosen reality for a full day to see if it feels like home.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Spoiler: You won't want to come back.</strong>

    <h2>Consultation Session</h2>
    
    <p>
      First things first: let's troubleshoot your current existence.<br><br>

      During your consultation, we‚Äôll dive into your life‚Äôs plot twists, career dilemmas, friendship dilemmas, existential subplots, and whether you really needed to binge watch that TV show.<br><br>

      Then, you'll be assigned a Quantum Architect with excellent credentials and a questionable caffeine addiction.<br><br>

      To ensure maximum honesty, you'll be given a mild truth serum (known side effects: speaking your mind, rethinking life choices, and occasional spontaneous wisdom).<br><br>

      The real question is:<br>
      Are you ready for a brand new universe...<br>
      or do you just need a really good nap and a hug?
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; color: #999; margin-top: 20px;">
      Disclaimer: Truth serum results may include unexpected life decisions. Proceed with reckless optimism.

    <h2>Meet Your Assigned Scientist</h2>
    <img src="img/portal.png" alt="Multiverse Portal" class="consultation-image">
    <p>
      After your truth serum-fueled consultation, we‚Äôll assign you a highly trained (and questionably socialized) Quantum Architect.<br><br>
      They have a PhD in Interdimensional Engineering, a minor in Existential Crisis Management, and a major in Being Slightly Socially Awkward.<br><br>
      Over the course of five intensive sessions, you‚Äôll collaborate to stitch together the perfect alternate reality (hopefully with fewer bad decisions this time).<br><br>
      And because jumping timelines isn‚Äôt exactly a low-impact sport, you also are required to join the Interdimensional Physical Training Program‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. Don't worry, we won't make you do burpees, just enough training to make sure you don't fall through the void.<br><br>
      This isn‚Äôt just a glow-up.<br>
      It‚Äôs a reality reboot.

    <h2>Reality Reschedule Plan</h2>
    <img src="img/glitch.png" alt="Reality Reschedule Portal" class="reschedule-image">
    <p>
      Survived your consultation? Partnered with a Quantum Architect? Feeling only mildly overwhelmed? Perfect.<br><br>

      Welcome to the Reality Reschedule Plan‚Ñ¢Ô∏è. Here's what‚Äôs ahead:<br><br>

      <strong>Session 1: Timeline Diagnostics</strong><br>
      We review your life so far: wins, weird twists, and those "what was I thinking?" moments.<br><br>

      <strong>Session 2: Desire Mapping</strong><br>
      Dream out loud. No dream too small. No judgment here.Let's work to turn your dreams into reality.<br><br>

      <strong>Session 3: Reality Engineering</strong><br>
      You and your Quantum Architect sketch the upgrades: new dreams, new pathways, maybe even a cooler catchphrase.<br><br>

      <strong>Session 4: Quantum Troubleshooting</strong><br>
      We troubleshoot future glitches before they become time travel memes.<br><br>

      <strong>Session 5: Final Technical Calibration</strong><br>
      Finalize your blueprint and get ready to launch. Future you is already writing thank-you notes.<br><br>
    
      Meanwhile, <strong>Physical Training Sessions</strong> are required on the side to prep your body for the timeline transition because if you trip mid-jump, you might end up in a reality where taxes are even worse.<br><br>

      Reality Reboot isn‚Äôt just a glow-up.  
      It‚Äôs going to flip your reality in ways you didn't think were possible. Are you ready?
