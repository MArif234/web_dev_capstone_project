# 🌌 Reality Reboot

**Reality Reboot** is a fictional, interactive website experience that blends science fiction, existential humor, and speculative design. It is a parody pop-up event portal where users can RSVP for a journey to an alternate universe and maybe rethink their life choices along the way.

Welcome to a world where quantum consultations, timeline diagnostics, and truth serum therapy are just part of the daily itinerary.

“Ever wonder what life would be like if you made different choices? Well, wonder no more. We have a portal for that”

## 🌀 About the Project

Reality Reboot is a funky, fantasy-style website that invites users to imagine and interact with alternate versions of themselves and their lives. It plays on the idea of alternate reality and the emotional drama of modern existence with a twist.

This site was created for fun, creativity, and a bit of "what if" storytelling. It is fully fictional but let’s be honest, don’t we all want a timeline ctrl + Z button?
