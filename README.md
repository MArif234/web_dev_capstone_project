# 🌌 Reality Reboot

**Reality Reboot** is a fictional, interactive website experience that blends science fiction, existential humor, and speculative design. It's a parody pop-up event portal where users can RSVP for a journey to an alternate universe — and maybe rethink their life choices along the way.

Welcome to a world where **quantum consultations**, **timeline diagnostics**, and **truth serum therapy** are just part of the daily itinerary.

> “Ever wonder what life would be like if you made different choices? Well, wonder no more. We’ve got a portal for that.”

## 🌀 About the Project

Reality Reboot is a **funky, fantasy-style website** that invites users to imagine and interact with alternate versions of themselves and their lives. It plays on the idea of multiverse theory and the emotional drama of modern existence — with a tongue-in-cheek twist.

This site was created for fun, creativity, and a bit of "what if?" storytelling. It's fully fictional (but, let’s be honest, don’t we all want a timeline ctrl + Z button?)

## ✨ Features

• RSVP for your own reality jump consultation  
• Meet your socially awkward Quantum Architect  
• Participate in 5-stage timeline rescheduling sessions  
• Engage with a highly questionable truth serum (results may include epiphanies)  
• Attend food and mingling events with fellow rebooters  
• Join the Interdimensional Physical Training Program™️  

## 🔮 Experience Flow

Here’s what attendees can expect:

1. **Intro Presentation** – We ruin everything you thought you knew about your existence  
2. **Free Consultation** – It’s like therapy, but with more timelines  
3. **Scientist Assignment** – Your very own Quantum Architect (PhD included)  
4. **Reality Reschedule Plan** – A 5-part plan to reshape your existence  
5. **Food and Mingling** – Because rebooting reality is hungry work  
6. **Reality Launch** – Step into your new universe (no refunds)
